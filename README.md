# Ah Now I See
An original web based visual novel written in Javascript using Monogatari engine.
Currently a work in progress, hope to have it released soon for PC and mobile.

## Synopsys
In this piece we follow the story of Emily, with a personal quirk, who lives
in a not so happy-go-lucky world trying to make it through everyday. As it's my
first real fictional work, the story is quite brief as the world around Emily
falls apart almost as it's being built to the reader.

## Credits
Thanks to my friend, [Calvin] (https://github.com/aolyf), for providing the soundtracks used in the game. And to
[Diego Islas Ocampo] (https://github.com/HyuchiaDiego), for Monogatari.js . All other scripting and creative writing
belongs to me. Images are transformative under fair use.
